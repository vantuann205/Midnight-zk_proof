//! Incrementally Verifiable Computation (IVC).
//!
//! This module provides a framework for producing succinct proofs that a given
//! state is the result of applying a chain of transitions to a genesis state:
//!
//! ```text
//! genesis --w0--> s1 --w1--> s2 --w2--> ... --wN--> sN
//! ```
//!
//! Each transition step consumes a (secret) witness `wi` and advances the
//! state. The resulting proof attests that the final state `sN` was reached
//! legitimately without revealing any of the intermediate states or witnesses.
//!
//! Crucially, the proof size and verification time are *constant* regardless of
//! the number of steps `N`: the prover folds each new step into the existing
//! proof incrementally rather than proving the entire chain from scratch.
//!
//! Note that `N` (the number of steps) is **not** revealed by the proof. If
//! the chain length is relevant, it can be tracked by including a counter in
//! the state that the transition function increments at each step.
