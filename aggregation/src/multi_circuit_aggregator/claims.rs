//! Claims and supporting traits for multi-circuit aggregation.
//!
//! A [`Claim`] is a `(vk, statement)` pair representing the assertion that
//! `statement` holds under the inner circuit identified by `vk`. The aggregator
//! collects one claim per IVC step.
//!
//! Because different inner circuits have different statement types, statements
//! are stored as `Box<dyn Statement>` so they can be handled uniformly.
//! The [`AggregableRelation`] trait marks a
//! [`Relation`](midnight_zk_stdlib::Relation) as aggregation-compatible
//! and [`TypedStatement`] bridges it to the [`Statement`] trait object.
