# Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Before submitting a PR, please read through this document.

## Before you start

Search the issue tracker to see if your bug or feature request already exists. For larger changes - refactors, new subsystems, significant API changes - open an issue first and discuss it with us.

## Requirements

**Sign your commits.** All commits must be signed.

**Update the CHANGELOG.** Every crate you modify must include a corresponding entry in its `CHANGELOG.md` describing what changed and why. Each `CHANGELOG.md` lives in the crate’s own folder.


**Keep it simple.** Write the least code that solves the problem. Short, obvious, easy to maintain. Avoid clever solutions. We value code that is straightforward enough that reviewing it doesn't take longer than writing it would have.

**Match the style.** Follow the conventions already in the codebase - naming, formatting, structure.

**Document your functions.** Public functions need doc comments. Be concise and accurate.

**Add tests.** New functionality should come with tests that cover the expected behavior.

**License header.** All new files should include:
